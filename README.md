### Vercel
#### You can also find my Vercel page here [Vercel](https://dgm-3770-svelte.vercel.app/) or on the main page of the repository in the about section.

### Login Form
#### The login form will be found here [Login Component](https://github.com/Andyrooooo/DGM3770_Svelte/blob/master/svelte_practice_project/src/routes/loginComponent/%2Bpage.svelte) and will now be populated as soon as the component is added to the page with onMount

### Writeable Stores
#### We now also have three writable stores. One to store our message modal information, one to store the message modal's actual message, and one custom store which stores the user data. I have made the last store custom for later purposes. The store path will be located at the root of our routes page in a file called "svelteTutorialUsers.js". The link is located here [Writeable Stores](https://github.com/Andyrooooo/DGM3770_Svelte/blob/master/svelte_practice_project/src/routes/svelteTutorialUsers.js)

### Motions
#### Our Motions component will utilize the "tween" motion, which can be found on the landing page of the app under the "motion" button. [Motions parent Component](https://github.com/Andyrooooo/DGM3770_Svelte/blob/master/svelte_practice_project/src/routes/motion/%2Bpage.svelte) and the component will be located Here [Tweens Motion Component](https://github.com/Andyrooooo/DGM3770_Svelte/blob/master/svelte_practice_project/src/routes/motion/tweens.svelte)

### OAuth 
#### The OAuth will be visible as soon as you go to my page, and will require you to authenticate in order to view the tutorial. The code will be visible in the parent component here: [Parent Component](https://github.com/Andyrooooo/DGM3770_Svelte/blob/master/svelte_practice_project/src/routes/%2Bpage.svelte). You can also view the auth file where the local environment variable points to but is empty.
